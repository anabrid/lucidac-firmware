\mainpage REDAC Firmware API Documentation (Doxygen)

This documentation covers the C++ firmware for the hybrid controller (microcontroller on Ctrl-block) of the
[analog-digital hybrid computer LUCIDAC](https://anabrid.com/lucidac) (and REDAC) made
by [anabrid](https://anabrid.com/).

This documentation is generated with *Sphinx* and *Doxygen*. Please note that all supplementary
texts are part of the Sphinx documentation while the Doxygen part covers the API cross reference.
That is, doxygen builds an in-depth crossreference
for the actual code which can be browsed either by [Namespace](namespace.html), by
[Class name](annotated.html) or by [Folder structure](files.html). Next to this extracted
documentation, the documentation is supplemented with various introductive and overview
documents [which you read in the *Sphinx* part](https://anabrid.dev/docs/lucidac-firmware/sphinx/)
