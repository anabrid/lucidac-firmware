# Manual Tests

> &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; Warning: Manual tests may misuse the testing framework and may not even end at all!

Manual tests must run on actual hardware and can not be used otherwise.
They are not automated, may misuse the testing framework and may not even end at all.
All manual tests should be used separately.

These are only for use during hardware and firmware development.
Anything that can be tested properly should receive a test case in one of the other folders (native, emulated or hardware).
