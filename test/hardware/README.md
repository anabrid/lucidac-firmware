# Hardware Tests

Hardware tests must run on actual hardware and can not be used otherwise.
They are categorized into

* [components/](`components`) tests, which test single components (e.g. a single block).
* [integrated/](`integrated`) tests, which use multiple components to either test their interaction or generate test inputs for other components

Non-finished or non-automatic tests during development should be started in [../manual]() and moved here once they are production ready.
